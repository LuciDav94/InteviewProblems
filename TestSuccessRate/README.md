Giving a list of test cases and a list with the results, please compute the success rate from same test case family: 
For example:
{"test1a", "test2", "test1b", "test1c"} -> only 2 test cases from same family: test1 and test2
{"Wrong answer", "OK", "Runtime error", "OK",} -> Only "test2" family was completely successful -> answer is 50% success rate
